# Notice: WADE has been superseded by TrashAI which can be found here: https://github.com/code4sac/trash-ai

Did you know there is a website where you can upload pictures of trash and the program will identify the trash in the images for you? 
Now you do! We'd like to introduce you to Trash AI, an open sourced project. Inspired initially by WADE AI, a Let's Do It World project, Trash AI was developed and is maintained by Code for Sacramento and Sponsored by the Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research.
